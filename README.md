I build a web application called Rock, Paper, Scissors. This web application is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

I started by creating a gem file and installing the relevent gems such as 'sinatra', 'webrick' and 'sinatra-contrib' so I can use sinatra on my current ruby version (3.0.0) and so my server reloads itself automatically whenever I make a change in the app.rb file.
